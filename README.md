### Decimator - Blender Plugin

This plugin is actually a macro for Blender that uses the already existing Decimate Modifier for asset optimization and polygon decimation. I developed it for personal use to improve performance on larger scenes, specially when they are imported from other software and formats, such as *.fbx or Autodesk Revit architectural files, for example.
