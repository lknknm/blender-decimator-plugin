### Decimator - Blender Plugin

This plugin is actually a macro for Blender that uses the already existing Decimate Modifier for asset optimization and polygon decimation. I developed it for personal use to improve performance on larger scenes, specially when they are imported from other software and formats, such as *.fbx or Autodesk Revit architectural files, for example.

## How to use it

After the plugin is installed, in Object Mode press Ctrl+Shift+D to bring the Decimator pie menu and select the desired Angle Limit.
For simple objects, 5Â° Angle Limit is more than enough.
